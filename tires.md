## Date of manufacture, and expiration date:
- Expiration dates for tires manufactured before 2000 were based on a 10-year scale because the expected life-span of a tire was 10 years. Current guidance suggests that tires should be expected to last a maximum of only six years.
- All Dunlop tires also specify the date of manufacture on the sidewall. It is important to pay attention to these dates as tires can become unsafe if they are stored too long or in poor storage conditions.  On the side wall next to the U.S. DOT tire identification number you will find a 4-digit number.  The first 2 digits indicate the **week of its manufacture** and the last two are for the **year**.  In our example the 0916 translates to the 9th week in the year 2016.

## Tire codes
- **180** = the 180 designates the tire’s width in millimeters, measured in a straight line through the tire from one edge of the tire’s tread to the other.
- **65** = The second number, 65, is a bit trickier to understand. This represents the aspect ratio between the tire’s width and its height; or how tall a tire is in relationship to its width. Simply put, the higher this number is, the taller the tire will be. In this case, the tire is 65 percent as tall as its width.

- **16** = The last number, 16, is the tire’s rim diameter expressed in inches.

- The letter(s) after the aspect ratio, in our case a “**B**”, indicate speed rating and/or tire construction. If there are two letters after the aspect ratio, the first will be speed rating and the second will be tire construction. The “B” stands for Bias Belted.  You might see an “**R**” for Radial or a “D” for diagonal bias.
